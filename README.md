# malachite-bigint

A drop-in replacement for rust [num-bigint](https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint) based on [malachite](https://github.com/mhogrefe/malachite) `Natural`.

This is not an official malachite project. Please directly use malachite unless you need num-bigint compatibility.

# Performance

# Acknowledgement

`malachite-bigint` was created by [Steve Shi](https://github.com/qingshi163) to provide an alternative bigint implementation for [RustPython](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython.git).

This project is contributed to the malachite project and will be integrated to malachite 0.5.0.
